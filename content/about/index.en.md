I am a PhD student in [Jens Eisert group](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-eisert/index.html) at the Free University of Berlin.

My research interests interface with all aspects of **Quantum Information Theory** and **Quantum Computing**.
I enjoy working on the more mathematical aspects, such as **Learning Theory** or **Random Unitaries**, as well as addressing more applied questions in **Quantum Machine Learning**.
I am also interested in topics from **Theoretical Computer Science**, **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**.
In my research I love to combine rigorous mathematical-theoretical tools with programming tools. 

For a list of my publications, see my [Research webpage](/research) and my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=_kWrHQwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra).
