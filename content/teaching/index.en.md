## Quantum Information, 2022-23 (Tutorials, FU Berlin)

---

>  **New message** : Next Tuesday, we'll finish Problem Sheet 4, and continue with Problem Sheet 5. 

---
Students can send me the week's exercises (photos of the sheets or notes written on tablet) via e-mail [:(fas fa-envelope):](mailto:antoniomele.p@gmail.com). For my tutorial, the usual deadline for submitting the exercises is Sunday at 11:59 pm.
 
Email me if you would like to be added to the mailing list that I will use for quick communications related to my tutorials.
This webpage can be useful for the students especially to have the tablet notes that I write and use for my tutorials.

### Theory

The main page of the course is [here](https://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/ag/ag-eisert/teaching/ws22-23/index.html), where you can find the Lecture notes of the course written by Jens Eisert.
 
Other good Quantum Information notes are those written by John Preskill, which can be found [here](http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph219/index.html#lecture). 

The book written by Nielsen & Chuang can be found [here](http://mmrc.amss.cas.cn/tlb/201702/W020170224608149940643.pdf). 

A good reference for Quantum Shannon Theory is the book of Mark Wilde, which can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1106.1445.pdf).
