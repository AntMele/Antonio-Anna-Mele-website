[{"categories":null,"content":" Click here for a detailed Curriculum Vitae CV . Feel free to reach me by email . I am a PhD student in Jens Eisert group at the Free University of Berlin. My research interests interface with all aspects of Quantum Information Theory and Quantum Computing. I enjoy working on the more mathematical aspects, such as Quantum Tomography, Learning Theory or Random Unitaries, as well as addressing more applied questions in Quantum Machine Learning. I am also interested in topics from Theoretical Computer Science, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. In my research I love to combine rigorous mathematical-theoretical tools with programming tools. For a list of my publications, see my Research webpage and my Google Scholar profile.
